# CalendarShannon

Used SparkJava, Room, ViewModel and LiveData to create a calendar app. This was my first attempt to create/work with a local 
server and so I spent most of my time trying to understand how that works/how to do this with SparkJava. 
My database is not updating my UI so for future improvements I'd work on updating the fields for the entity with the user input.
